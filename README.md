Introduction
Hello Everyone! I am a student of the Promineo class through the University of New Mexico's Continuing Education Program. I am hoping to have a career in the coding field by the end of August! Currently I work as a fireplace service technician at a family-owned store here in New Mexico.

I have been a Dungeon Master in Dungeons and Dragons since the pandemic started and I absolutely love it! I also am a pretty big gamer and love table top games as well.
